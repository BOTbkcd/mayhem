## Installation

```
go install github.com/BOTbkcd/mayhem@latest

- SQLite is a dependency for this tool, make sure it is installed beforehand (It is fairly ubiquitous & should already be present on your system).




## Features

- Three pane responsive layout, auto adjusts when terminal is resized

- Vim key bindings for navigation

- Tasks:

  - Completion Status:
    - Tasks can be marked finished/unfinished using `Tab` key
    - Each stack has a label which denotes the number of unfinished tasks in that stack
  - A task can be broken down into associated *<u>steps</u>* 
    - Individual steps can be marked as finished as progress is made

  - Recurring tasks:
    - A recurring task will begin from the specified start time & repeat after the recurrence interval until the deadline is reached
    - A recurring task can only be temporarily marked as finished. It will resurface after the recurrence interval.
    - The deadline can be extended as per requirement
    - They are marked in task table using `üìå` icon

- Sorting:

  - Stacks are sorted alphabetically by default
  - Tasks are sorted by completion status, then deadline, then priority & then by title
    - Unscheduled tasks have less precedence than scheduled tasks

- Pane Footer: each pane has a footer which your relative position in the pane

- Dynamic help section at the bottom shows the relevant key bindings available at a given instance
